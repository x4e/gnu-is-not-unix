# GNU Is Not Unix

When you ask someone "What does GNU stand for?" you often get an answer like:

> GNU is Not Unix

Which is about as useful as telling you that pi equals 3.14.

That is why I have attempted to answer this question myself.
Unfortunately, just like pi, we may never know the full answer but at least we can get as close as possible.

## Usage

```
tcc -run main.c
```
